Hey, I’m Régis.

I’m a developer and product designer, currently living in Montréal. I build tools that help people have a better life. I work mainly on two projects to achieve this goal.

- 🚜  &nbsp; I’m currently working on [OfficeLife](https://github.com/officelifehq/officelife), the only tool a company will ever need to manage their employees. It will be released in 2021.
- 🚀 &nbsp; I’ve created [Monica](https://github.com/monicahq/monica), the most popular open source personal CRM, with over 40 000+ users and installed on 20k+ servers.

### Open source work

Everything I do is in the open. I’ve created many popular repositories on GitHub and give away my code for free, either in MIT or BSD-3 licenses. I strongly believe that open source helps us create better tools.

👏 Thanks for visiting this page and have a great day!
