🖖

I’m a developer living in Montréal. I build tools that help people have a better life, in their personal and/or professional lives. I work mainly on two projects to achieve this goal.

- 🚜  &nbsp; I’m currently working on [OfficeLife](https://github.com/officelifehq/officelife), the only tool a company will ever need to manage their employees. It will be released in 2022.
- 🚀 &nbsp; I’ve created [Monica](https://github.com/monicahq/monica), the most popular open source personal CRM, with over 40 000+ users and installed on 20k+ servers.
